- Concepts

  - Paradigms: Mounting vs. migrating a resource
  - Frontends: Path vs. slice. vs. file and limitations
  - Direct vs. Managed Mounts: The role of background push and pull
  - Backends: Interface and pre-made backends to choose from (including RPC backend)
  - Seeder: Interface and transports (dudirekta/fRPC/gRPC)
  - Chunking: When it is required and how to use it

- Usage
  - Mapping a remote resource into memory with the Direct Mount API
  - Efficiently mounting a remote resource with the Managed Mount API
  - Migrating a memory region between two hosts with the Migration API
