## Overview

ðŸš§ This project is a work-in-progress! Instructions will be added as soon as it is usable. ðŸš§

r3map enables high-performance remote memory region mounts and migrations in user space.

It enables you to ...

- **Mount and migrate memory regions with a unified API**: r3map provides a consistent API, no matter if a memory region should simply be accessed or migrated between hosts.
- **Expose a resource with multiple frontends**: By providing multiple interfaces (such as a memory region and a file/path) for accessing or migrating a resource, integrating remote memory into existing applications is possible with little to no changes.
- **Transparently map almost any resource into memory, only fetching chunks as they are being read**: By exposing a simple backend interface and being fully transport-independent, r3map makes it possible to map resources such as a S3 bucket, Cassandra or Redis database, or even a tape drive into a memory region efficiently, as well as migrating a region over a framework and protocol of your choice, such as gRPC.
- **Use remote memory without the associated overhead**: Despite being in user space, r3map manages (on a [typical desktop system](https://pojntfx.github.io/networked-linux-memsync/main.html#testing-environment)) to achieve **high throughput (up to 3 GB/s)** with **minimal access latencies (~100Âµs)** and **short initialization times (~15ms)**.
- **Adapt to challenging network environments**: By implementing various optimizations such as background pull and push, two-phase protocols for migrations and concurrent device initialization, r3map can be deployed both in low-latency, high-throughput local datacenter networks and more constrained networks like the public internet.

The project is accompanied by a scientific thesis, which provides additional insights into design decisions, the internals of its implementation and comparisons to existing technologies and alternative approaches:

## Installation

You can add r3map to your Go project by running the following:

```shell
$ go get github.com/pojntfx/r3map/...@latest
```

## Reference

### Mounts and Migrations

There are two fundamental use cases for r3map: Mounts and migrations. Mounting refers to accessing a resource, where the resource (such as a S3 bucket, remote file or memory region, tape drive etc.) is made available locally as either read-only or read-write, without having to download the entire resource first. Mounts work similarly to `mmap`, except the can map almost any resource into memory, not just files. To learn more about mounts, see the [Push-Pull Synchronization with Mounts](https://pojntfx.github.io/networked-linux-memsync/main.html#push-pull-synchronization-with-mounts) chapter in the accompanying thesis.

Migration refers to moving a resource like a memory region and moving it from one host to another. While mounts are optimized to have low initialization latencies and the best possible throughput performance, migrations are optimized to have the smallest possible downtime, where downtime refers to the typically short period in the migration process where neither the source nor the destination host can write to the resource that is being migrated. To optimize for this, migrations have a two-phase protocol which splits the device initialization and critical migration phases into two distinct parts, which keeps downtime to a minimum. To learn more about mounts, see the [Pull-Based Synchronization with Migrations](https://pojntfx.github.io/networked-linux-memsync/main.html#pull-based-synchronization-with-migrations) chapter in the accompanying thesis.
